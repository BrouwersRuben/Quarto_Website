                    We based our game <Strong><em>'Gnome Explorers'</em></Strong> of the already existing and successful game
                    <Strong><em>'Dwarf Fortress'</em></Strong>.
                </p>
                <img src="media/DwarfFortressLogo.png" alt="Logo of Dwarf Fortress" id="DwarfFortress">
                <p>
                    Dwarf Fortress was officially made by <Strong>Bay12</Strong> in 2006. His original goal was <em>"to create
                    a fantasy world simulator in which it is possible to take part in a rich history, occupying a variety of roles
                    through the course of several games."</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We tried to fulfil this as closely as possible, as our game is smaller and as we had less time and manpower to
                    develop, we had to skip out on some of the features that "Dwarf Fortress" does give you, like auto generating maps,
                    a detailed storyline and many many treasures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gnome Explorers is a high intensity, easy to play, no story line, heartbeat raising game, with an easter egg...<br>
                    Make sure to play it and let us know if you find the way to the <em>golden chamber</em> yourself, or perhaps beat some of our high scores!

                <!--I took this out of our scope document-->
                <p>We are developing a game to aid in our training to become proficient developers and improve on the skills
                    needed for each of the memberâ€™s roles. The game will entertain all types of audiences and provide a great
                    user experience of a retro ASCII game with RPG elements about Gnomes exploring dungeons.
                    Our team will take a simple approach to world generation and objectives for the player</p>
