                        <p>Quarto is a board game for two players invented by Swiss mathematician Blaise Müller (who you can see on the left).
                            It is published and copyrighted by Gigamic.</p>

                            <p>
                                The game is played on a 4×4 board. There are 16 unique pieces to play with, each of which is either:
                                <p>
                                    Tall or short, <br>
                                    dark or light, <br>
                                    square or circular, <br>
                                    hollow or solid, <br>
                                </p>
                                <p> 
                                    Players take turns choosing a piece which the other player must then place on the board.
                                    A player wins by placing a piece on the board which forms a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row of four pieces,
                                    all of which have a common attribute (all short, all circular, etc.). A variant rule included in many editions gives
                                    a second way to win by placing four matching pieces in a 2×2 square.
                                </p>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Quarto is distinctive in that there is only one set of common pieces, rather than a set for one player 
                                and a different set for the other. It is therefore an impartial game.</p>

                    <!--I took this out of our scope document-->
                    <p>We are making this game to prepare ourselves for our further working career, where we will probably encounter similar projects,
                        where we also have to work with clients first, listen to their feedback, and then implement it on a project that we have not 
                        chosen ourselves. This project also helps us to build team building and communication skills that we will need in our future lives. </p>
