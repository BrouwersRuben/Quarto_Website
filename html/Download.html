                <h2>Downloading our game!</h2>
                <h1>Thank you so much for making it this far, and being interested in downloading our game!</h1>
                <p>The first step in downloading our game is clicking the first button labeled <strong>"Quarto JAR file"</strong> and downloading the file that is attached to it.</p>
                <!-- TODO: Redirect to thankyou page after downloading -->
                <a href="../download/Game/quarto.jar" class="quartoGame" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Quarto JAR file</strong></a>
                <p>After downloading this file, you will also need <strong>JavaFX</strong> on your system to run our game. This you can donwload from <a href="https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="link">this link</a>.<br>
                    <em>(You will need a JavaFX from the version 11 or higher, and also a correct version of the Java Runtime Environment)</em>
                    You just select your operating system, and run the executable. Make sure you remember in which directory you save the program files, because you will need the 
                    path to the lib folder later.</p>
                <p>Next step on the list is to download the zip file with the wallet for our database, this is just a zip file which you have to extract into a map with the JAR file, 
                    so you should have a directory with the JAR file and the extracted zip folder of the wallet.</p>
                    <a href="About.html" class="quartoGame"><strong>For the wallet file: Please contact us.</strong></a>
                <p>Then you should open the command line from withing the directory with the JAR file and the Database wallet, and type this into the command line:</p>
                <pre>java \
                --module-path <strong>YOUR PATH</strong>/javafx/javafx-sdk-11.0.2/lib <br>
                (Your version may differ) <br>
                --add-modules=javafx.controls,javafx.media <br>
                -jar quarto.jar</pre>
                <p>After this you should be able to succesfully run the game. If this is not the case, please <a href="About.html" class="link">contact us</a> and we will walk you through the installation.
                </p>
